## IMU based orientation estimation

- A method to estimate the orientation

![VQF: orientation estimation](./Images/2025-01-15/1.png)

- 6D orientation estimation, with only gyroscope and accelerometer, 3 from each
- 9D orientation estimation, includes magnetometer as well
- Heading: north-south alignment
- Position can be estimated through double integration of the acceleration, after accounting for gravity
- Rest detection
  - ~ When the current values and average values match within a threshold for some duration

- Bias can be estimated from the readings during rest

- $\mathcal{S}_i \to$ Body frame of the sensor
- Initially $\mathcal{I}_i$ and $\mathcal{S}_i$ are aligned, but over time they drift apart due to the inclination, captured in $\mathcal{I}_i$
- Initially $\varepsilon_i$ and $\varepsilon$ are aligned, but over time they drift due to the heading
- Magnetometer correction just includes one number, the angle $\delta_i$

### Factored filter structure

![Proposed factored filter structure](./Images/2025-01-15/3.png)

- Mainly, in VQF, can isolate the impact of the magnetometer disturbances
- $\boxed{z^{-1}} \implies$ Delay

- Gravity magnitude also changes slightly, but we're interested only in the magnitude

### Algorithm-1: `BasicVQF`

![Algorithm-1: `BasicVQF`](./Images/2025-01-15/4.png){ width=60% }

- Heading offset from the magnetic sample is only calculated from $m_x, m_y$; ~Aligned to the plane of the sensor
- $0 \leq k_{\text{mag}} \leq 1$, like a Kalman gain
  - $k_{\text{mag}} = 0 \implies$ Ignore the measurement, take only the previous estimate
  - $k_{\text{mag}} = 1 \implies$ Ignore the previous estimate, take only the measurement

### Gyro bias estimation

- ~ A residual bias exists even after accounting for the inclination error
- Adjoint operation: Here turns out to be $R$
- Pre-multipying, and post-multiplying by $R$
- **Papers:** Sola et. al., Micro lie theory
- Low-pass filtering the rotation matrix values

$$
R \ [\omega]_\times R^\top = [R\omega]_\times
$$

### Gyro bias Kalman filter

- Kalman filter predicts how the means and covariances change
- Random variables are all assumed to be multivariate normal
- Process covariance is added, in the prediction step

---

- Kalman filter code and papers vary a little bit
- Disturbance rejection, etc, in the code
- Paper reading
  - Not necessary to sequentially read the sections
  - Reading a bunch of papers, assumptions made, etc, from citations
  - Discussions with peers
