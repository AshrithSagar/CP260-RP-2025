## Particle filters

- References:
  - Thrun, Chapter 4, 8

- Particles are samples of a distribution
- For non-linear functions, output need not be Gaussian even if the input is Gaussian

## Mobile robot localisation problem

- IMU cannot be used for long-term localisation

- Landmarks are features of the environment

  - Each landmark has a unique location and ID
  - ID can be a high-dimensional vector, in general

- Map: A set of landmarks
  $$
  m = \left\{ (l_x^1, l_y^1, l_z^1), \ (l_x^2, l_y^2, l_z^2), \dots, \ (l_x^s, l_y^s, l_z^s) \right\}
  $$

- Robot's pose at time step $k$ is $X_k = (x_k, y_k, \theta_k)$

- Robot makes a measurement $Z_k = (l_{1k}, l_{2k}, \dots, l_{mk})$
- Localisation problem: Estimate $p(X_k \mid X_0, u_{1:k}, Z_{1:k}, m)$
- SLAM
  - Doing the map building and localisation together
  - Can handle dynamical changes
- Handling objects, choosing whether to be a part of the map
- Reducing localisation error by using sensor fusion, from multiple modalities

## Importance sampling

## Basic particle filter algorithm
